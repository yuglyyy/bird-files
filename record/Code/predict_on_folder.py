"""
This script performs bird song detection on audio files in a folder by converting the audio to spectrogram images,
running the Bird Song Detector from BIRDeep project YOLO model to detect bird songs, and then transforming the predictions to time segments.

Workflow:
1. Load the YOLO model for bird song detection.
2. Clean the output folder to ensure no previous results interfere.
3. Convert the input audio files to spectrogram images.
4. Perform detection on the spectrogram images using the YOLO model.
5. Read the predictions from the output folder.
6. Transform the predictions to time segments and save the results.

Variables:
- model: The YOLO model loaded with pre-trained weights for bird song detection.
- audio_folder: Path to the folder containing input audio files.
- audio_name: Name of the audio file without the extension.
- image_path: Path to the saved spectrogram image.
- predictions_txt: Path to the text file containing the YOLO model predictions.
